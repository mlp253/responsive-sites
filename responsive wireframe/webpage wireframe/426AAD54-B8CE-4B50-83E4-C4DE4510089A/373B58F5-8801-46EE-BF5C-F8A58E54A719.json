He completed his undergraduate degree in History and Theory of Architecture from Carleton, with a term abroad at the University of Edinburgh. Peter has worked as an interpreter in the Natural Heritage Education department of Murphys Point Provincial Park for the past two summers, gaining experience in research and public engagement."
